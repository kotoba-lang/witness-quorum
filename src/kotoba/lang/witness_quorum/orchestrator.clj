(ns kotoba.lang.witness-quorum.orchestrator
  "Witnessed write orchestrator.

  Composes the substrate-pure write primitive, the witness selector, and the
  quorum reducer into a single L1-witnessed write that returns only when:
    - the record was committed to PDS (via `write-fn`), AND
    - >= :quorum-threshold witness cells produced matching accept (or
      reject) attestations.

  CLJ port of this repo's original @etzhayyim/witness-quorum
  src/orchestrator.ts. JVM-only, and synchronous throughout (unlike the TS
  original's async/Promise plumbing) -- see the repo README for the
  adaptation notes below.

  Per kotoba-datomic SPEC S5 + ADR-2605231400 S\"Implementation plan\" #2-#4."

  `opts`:
    :write-fn        `(fn [write-opts] -> {:uri ... :cid ...})`. Adapts the
                      TS `WriteCapableClient.write` method into a plain
                      function -- idiomatic Clojure prefers a function over
                      a single-method object.
    :write-opts      passed through to `write-fn` (e.g. {:collection ... :record ... :rkey ...}).
    :fleet           seq of fleet-cell maps (see `selector/fleet-cell`).

                      `subscribeAttestations` (which returned an
                      AsyncIterable) into a function returning a `poll-fn`
                      compatible with `quorum/collect-quorum`.
    :quorum-options  override; default derived from `rule`.
    :timeout-ms      total wall-clock budget. Default 30000.

  matching cell handler on a background thread (`future`), and makes the

  Unlike the TS original's lazy queue/waiters dance (needed there to avoid
  losing attestations that race ahead of a subscriber showing up), a
  `LinkedBlockingQueue` obtained via `computeIfAbsent` on the *same*
  quorum-group key from both the producer and the consumer side makes the
  ordering irrelevant -- whichever side arrives first creates the queue,
  and blocking put/poll do the rest.
