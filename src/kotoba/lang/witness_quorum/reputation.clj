(ns kotoba.lang.witness-quorum.reputation
  "Reputation-weighted witness selection (ADR-2607110300 Phase 4). Tracks
  each witness cell's historical agreement with the eventual quorum
  majority verdict, and lets selection exclude cells whose track record is
  poor -- the concrete mechanism 'reputation-weighted witness selection'
  takes here (exclusion below a threshold, not a continuous probability
  weight -- simpler, and sufficient without inventing a weighted sampler
  nothing else in this repo needs).

  Honesty note (ADR-2607110300 Phase 4): this is exercised against
  kotoba-lang/murakumo's real fleet.edn (a genuine production fleet
  inventory, not a synthetic mock) as the ADR's chosen validation path,
  but every cell in that fleet is still operated by the same party.
  Reputation tracking alone does not make the system
  '分散型経済/ブロックチェーン' -- see the ADR's Phase 4 labeling rule. It
  becomes meaningful once cells are run by independent third-party
  operators, which this module does not require or assume."
