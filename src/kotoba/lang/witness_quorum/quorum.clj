(defn quorum-state
  "Decide the quorum state for a record given the witness set and the
  attestations gathered so far. Pure function -- no I/O.

  `opts` (a map, merged over `default-quorum-options`):
    :quorum-size       total witnesses selected for this record. Default 5.
                        Must match `witnesses`' count.
    :quorum-threshold  minimum matching-verdict attestations required. Default 3.
    :escalation-policy  :reject | :council | :pending. Default :council.

  Semantics:
    - Filter `attestations` to those whose (:cell-node :cell-id) is in the
      witness set. Anything else is ignored.
    - For witnesses whose `selector/fleet-cell` carries a `:public-key`,
      verify each attestation's `:signature` against it (see
      `witness-signature-valid?`) -- a forged or missing signature for a
      witness with a KNOWN public key is dropped, not counted toward
      quorum. Witnesses with no declared `:public-key` can't be verified
      and their attestations pass through unverified.
    - Dedup by cell, keeping the latest `:attested-at` per cell.
    - Group by :verdict. If any verdict reaches :quorum-threshold, the
      record's state is decided by that majority verdict.
    - If the witness set is fully attested but no verdict reaches
      threshold: escalate per :escalation-policy.
    - Otherwise return {:kind :pending ...} with the remaining count.

(defn collect-quorum
  "Collect attestations from a blocking poll source until quorum is reached
  or all expected witnesses have responded.

  This is a synchronous JVM adaptation of the original TS `collectQuorum`,
  which raced an async-iterable source against a `setTimeout`. Here
  `poll-fn` is a function of one argument (`remaining-ms`) that blocks up to
  that many milliseconds waiting for the next attestation, and returns one of:
    {:status :value :value <attestation-map>}   -- got one
    {:status :timeout}                          -- no item arrived in time

  (`kotoba.lang.witness-quorum.orchestrator/create-in-memory-witness-transport`
  returns a `subscribe-attestations` function producing exactly this shape,
  backed by a `java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue`.)

  `opts` accepts the same keys as `quorum-state` plus:
    :timeout-ms  total wall-clock budget for quorum collection. Default 30000.
