(ns kotoba.lang.witness-quorum.orchestrator
  "Witnessed write orchestrator.

  Composes the substrate-pure write primitive, the witness selector, and the
  quorum reducer into a single L1-witnessed write that returns only when:
    - the record was committed to PDS (via `write-fn`), AND
    - >= :quorum-threshold witness cells produced matching accept (or
      reject) attestations.

  CLJ port of this repo's original @etzhayyim/witness-quorum
  src/orchestrator.ts. JVM-only, and synchronous throughout (unlike the TS
  original's async/Promise plumbing) -- see the repo README for the
  adaptation notes below.

  (witnessed / rejected / escalated) or the timeout fires.

  `opts`:
    :write-fn        `(fn [write-opts] -> {:uri ... :cid ...})`. Adapts the
                      TS `WriteCapableClient.write` method into a plain
                      function -- idiomatic Clojure prefers a function over
                      a single-method object.
    :write-opts      passed through to `write-fn` (e.g. {:collection ... :record ... :rkey ...}).
    :fleet           seq of fleet-cell maps (see `selector/fleet-cell`).

                      compatible with `quorum/collect-quorum`.
    :quorum-options  override; default derived from `rule`.
    :timeout-ms      total wall-clock budget. Default 30000.

(defn write-with-witnesses-precommit
  "Pre-commit variant of `write-with-witnesses` (ADR-2607110300 Phase 2):
  the write is proposed to witnesses BEFORE it is applied, and `commit-fn`
  only runs if the quorum reaches `:witnessed`. This is the difference
  between post-hoc cosign (the record already exists when witnesses see it)
  and pre-commit quorum (witnesses gate whether the record is applied at
  all).

  `opts` differs from `write-with-witnesses` in two keys:
    :propose-fn  `(fn [write-opts] -> {:uri ... :cid ...})`. Computes the
                 uri/cid the record WOULD have -- e.g. a local content-hash
                 derivation -- WITHOUT persisting anything. Must be
                 deterministic: the same `write-opts` must yield the same
                 :cid `commit-fn` will later persist, since witnesses sign
                 against this proposed cid.
    :commit-fn   `(fn [write-opts receipt] -> commit-result)`. Called ONLY
                 when the quorum state's :kind is :witnessed. Performs the
                 actual write/append. Not called on :rejected, :escalated,
                 or :pending.
  All other opts (:write-opts :fleet :rule :transport :quorum-options
  :timeout-ms) are unchanged from `write-with-witnesses`.

  Returns {:uri ... :cid ... :selected-witnesses [...] :state <quorum-state>
           :committed? bool :commit-result (present only when :committed? true)}.

  Note (honesty, per ADR-2607110300): this is crash-fault tolerance among
  witnesses operated by a single party, not Byzantine consensus -- there is
  no fork-choice/view-change for conflicting concurrent proposals. Callers
  must not represent this as BFT."

  slashing/apply-quorum-outcome (ADR-2607110300 Phase 4). Before this,
  reputation.clj and stake.clj were independently tested but nothing
  ever called them from the actual precommit flow -- a completed quorum
  round had no economic consequence for the witnesses who disagreed
  with it. This closes that gap: use this instead of
  write-with-witnesses-precommit when you want reputation/stake tracked
  automatically; use the plain version when you're managing those
  separately (e.g. batching many rounds before updating).

  Additional opts beyond write-with-witnesses-precommit:
    :reputation-db  current reputation db. Default reputation/empty-reputation.
    :stake-ledger   current stake ledger. Default stake/empty-ledger.
    :slash-amount   bond units removed from a disagreeing witness per

  reputation-db, updated stake-ledger, and this round's slash audit
