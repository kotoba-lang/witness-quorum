  Algorithm:
    1. Sort the fleet by composite key (stable selection universe).
    2. Compute sha256(record-cid) as a 256-bit integer.
    3. Step through the sorted fleet starting at offset (hash mod fleet-len)
       and take the next `quorum-size` distinct cells (wrapping).

  Properties: deterministic, stable under fleet reordering (sorted first),
  unbiased (sha256 -> uniform offset), re-validatable from the record CID
  alone. Throws if the fleet has fewer cells than `quorum-size`."
